        liking water is one thing, and swimming is another. Hedgehogs 
        are good swimmers and instinctively can start swimming without 
        any previous practice. In the wild, hedgehogs can run and swim 
        for up to 2km whilst searching for food each day.`,

        They can live in a wide range of habitats, including savannas, 
        forests, deserts, scrublands and suburban gardens.
